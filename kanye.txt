"so what you thinkin?" and i was like "man that shit tite" you know what i'm sayin' man what i'ma tell him? i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man i'm i'm just in chicago i'm trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts i'm trying to get on and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been one of my homeys that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like i'm just straight holdin' the phone gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u-haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk me and my mother drove to  "come on let's just go" newark new jersey i hadn't even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up  "kanye baby we're here" i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh 'heart of the city' and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans' birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i could see he's in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i did nothing like already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said "yo play that one beat for him" and i played 'heart of the city' and really i made 'heart of the city' i really wanted to give that beat to dmx  "no i think jay gon' like this one right here" and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'ooooooooooh' two days later i'm in baseline and i seen dame dame didn't know who i was and i was like "yo what's up i'm kanye"  "yo you that kid kanye?" "you that kid that gave all them beats to jay? yo this nigga got classics"  "jay got classics g" you know i ain't talkin shit i'm like "oh shit" and all this time i'm starstruck man i'm still thinking 'bout you know i'm picturing these niggaz on the show the streets is watching i'm lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hiphop was there i think tata john minnelli a bunch of people i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said "yo jay i could rap" and i spit this rap that said uh "i'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips" and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the west the rap was like real wack and shit so that's all the response he said "man that was tite"  "that that was cool that was hot" that was it you know i ain't get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre-- i love him for that and at this time you know i didn't have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these a&r's and they wanted beats from me so they'd call me up i'd play them some beats "gimme a beat that sound like jay-z" you know they dick riders whatever so i'll play them these post-blueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit i'll be like "yo but i rap too" hey i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them 'jesus walks' and they didn't sign me you know what happened it was some a&r's that fucked with me though but then like the heads it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw" like dave lotti fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man  "man you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign kanye for real" i'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up "y'all niggaz is stupid" let's just say i didn't get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasn't even a nigga you know? the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad  "we gonna change the game buddy" dame was like "yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure it's not wack"  "you gotta make sure it's not wack" then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs 'cause you know cam was in the room young guru and dame was in the room so i played actually it's a song that you'll never hear but maybe i might use it so it's called 'wow' "i go to jacob with 25 thou you go with 25 hundred wow i got eleven plaques on my walls right now you got your first gold single damn nigga wow" like the chorus went don't bite that chorus i might still use it so i play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"  "oh shit it's not even wack" "i ain't gonna front it's kinda hot"  "it's actually kinda hot" like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper and i'm sure dame figured 'like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and he's like "yo man we we on a brick we on a brick"  "you don't wanna catch a brick" you gotta be under an umbrella you'll get rained on i told hiphop and hiphop was all "oh word?" actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h that you know 'cause i told him i was gonna do it and i'm a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know i'm not gonna name no names but people told me "oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol and right-- the day i'm talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said "yo capitol pulled on the deal"  "yo capitol pulled out on the deal" and you know i told them that rocafella was interested and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i called g i said "man you think we could still get that deal with rocafella?"

   us living as we do upside down  and the new word to have is revolution  people don't even want to hear the preacher  spill or spiel because god's whole card has been thoroughly piqued  and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey  the youngsters who were programmed to continue  fucking up woke up one night digging  paul revere and nat turner as the good guys  america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes the signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina  we learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal  two long centuries buried in the musty vault  hosed down daily with a gagging perfume  america was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country  whose legs were then spread around the world  and a rapist known as freedom free doom  democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names  that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling  in the mother country's crotch what does webster say about soul? all i want is a good home and a wife and a children and some food to feed them every night after all is said and done build a new route to china if they'll have you who will survive in america? who will survive in america? who will survive in america? who will survive in america?

'cause we danced on the floor in the round baby  people always told me be careful of what you do and don't go around breaking young girls' hearts she came and stood right by me just the smell of sweet perfume this happened much too soon she called me to her room  chorus: billie jean is not my lover she's just a girl who claims that i am the one but the kid is not my son  billie jean is not my lover she's just a girl who claims that i am the one but the kid is not my son she says i am the one but the kid is not my son she says i am the one but the kid is not my son  billie jean is not my lover she's just a girl who claims that i am the one but the kid is not my son she says i am the one but the kid is not my son  she says i am the one (you know what you did (she says he is my son breaking my heart babe) she says i am the one  billie jean is not my lover billie jean is not my lover billie jean is not my lover billie jean is not my lover (don't billie jean) billie jean is not my lover billie jean is not my lover
